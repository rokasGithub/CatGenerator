- Cute Cat Generator Set up

1. Extract the file of a repository to a folder
2. Make sure node is install
3. Navigate inside of the extracted source folder and run npm -i from the command line
4. Run npm start from the command line
5. Search for the breed of cat (Chartreux), returns filtered list based on the search string. Warning displayed if no cats found.
6. Since api does not return url to an image, instead use 3 cat images and randomise for each result.

- Things that I would of liked to add.

1. Modal pop for each cat containing full details of cat properties.
2. Footer and menu with some company information and links.
3. Stripe/PayPal checkout so you can purchase the desired cat.
4. Further filtering of items returned from the API (push properties into <select values""> and filter based on selected value).
5. Cash the files as well as the API results
